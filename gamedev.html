		<h1>Game Development</h1>
		<hr color="black">
		<p>I love making games. It's about 75% of what I do at home.<br>
		<br>
		Currently, I am working on an RPG, or Role Playing Game. It is about a mage who escaped the clutches
		of the evil Dark King. This mage is on a quest to become the most powerful mage and defeat the
		Dark King once and for all.<br>

		(Itch is were I put all of my games.)<br>

		but only really for testing.</p>
